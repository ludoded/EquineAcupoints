<div style="text-align: left;">If you are new to Red light therapy, welcome! After learning about a variety of natural healing methods, we kept coming back to this therapy. We all live busy lives and have a full plate. When one of our pets get injured or sick, not only is it an emotional drain, it also can be financially and energetically a burden. Red light therapy is so simple to uuse, and most importantly, IT WORKS!&nbsp; <img src="red_light_therapy.jpg" width="320"></div><br>Red Light therapy is like having a vetrnarian in your own pocket.&nbsp; It is multi-functional, safe, and effective.&nbsp; It works by:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Reduces pain<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Heals injuries up to twice as fast <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Reduces scar tissue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Stimulates acupoints<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Eliminates viruses in the blood stream. <br><br>Red light therapy uses specialized devices within a specific color spectrum and power band to stimulate the body's natural ability to relieve pain and heal at a faster rate. Specifically, extensive studies have been conducted using Red as a color spectrum with overwhelmingly positive results. Our devices are created for the animal lover that wants to eliminate the frustration and panic that occurs when a pet becomes sick or sustains an injury. Because our devices do not create any heat, they can be used on acute injuries. <br>
